            Hello World! My name is <strong>Srinithi Doddapaneni</strong> and I
            am a first-year <em>Computer Science</em> major.
            <br />
            I&apos;m from the Bay Area, specifically <em>San Ramon</em>. I love
            hiking, playing basketball for fun, spending time in nature,
            listening to music, playing chess, and solving puzzles. One fun fact
            about me is that I&apos;ve kept every single letter written to me
            since 1st grade.
            <p>
              I am excited for this opportunity with Hack4Impact and to build
              projects that make a positive impact for nonprofits in SLO.
            </p>
