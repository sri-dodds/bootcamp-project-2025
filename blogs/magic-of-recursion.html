      Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way
     that would normally require human intelligence <br />or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.
      The use of artificial intelligence has increased drastically in the past few years and is now a part of many of our daily lives.<br /> In this post, we’ll explore how AI works, 
      including key concepts like <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>neural networks</strong>, and <strong>natural language processing</strong>.
      We'll also dive into the ethical considerations of AI <br /> from the viewpoint of a developer as well as biases in algorithms to its impact on jobs and privacy.
      Finally, we’ll look at real-world applications of AI in industries like healthcare, education, and transportation.

      Whether you’re new to AI or just curious about where it's going next, this post will give you a strong foundation.
